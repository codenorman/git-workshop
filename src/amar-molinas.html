    <p class="question">What are you looking to get out of these workshops?</p>
    <p class="answer"> These workshops seem like a great opportunity to learn skills useful to software developers. I have wanted to learn more about GitHub for a while now. I am also excited to learn about JavaSrcipt libraries like Node.js, and to learn more about functional programming, but the main reason I am interested in these meeting is simply to meet other software developers, and have fun learning with them.</p>
